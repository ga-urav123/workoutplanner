            EXERCISE NO.1

        <p>
            <b>Concentration Curls</b> <br>
            <b>Equipment Required:</b> Dumbbells, Flat Bench <br>
            * An oldie but a goodie, this biceps exercise has stood the test of time, BUT time and time again, people have gotten it wrong.it's called a concentration curl because it directly targets a concentrated area of your bicepâ€¦<br>

            * Sit on a bench holding a dumbbell with your elbow resting on your inner thigh at or below knee height, your arm hanging straight, and your palm facing out. <br>

            * Tighten your bicep and hold that tension as you raise the dumbbell up to your shoulder, bending at the elbow. When you reach the top of the curl, turn your bent pinky upward and your thumb downward. This will exaggerate the concentration and build that bicep even more. <br>

            * Keep your elbow on your inner thigh for each rep. <br>

            * Complete all reps on one side before switching to the other side. <br>

            * Exhale as you curl, pause, then inhale as you straighten.
