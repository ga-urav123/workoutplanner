            * “This exercise targets the long head of the triceps, which tends to be neglected—hence, it's one of my favorite barbell exercises,” Straub says. <br> 
            
            * “For the best results, your palms should be facing toward you—not away, as commonly done.”<br> <br>

            * Start this classic heavy-lifting move by lying on your back on a bench, grasping a barbell with a close grip just above your forehead, elbows bent so upper arms are perpendicular to the ceiling. <br><br>

            * With control, straighten your arms so the weight is over your chin; then bent to return to the start.
